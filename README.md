# Vehicle-routing-problem

It is a variant of a Travelling salesman problem (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem)

Let us assume that you have the following constriction: 1 vehicle and 1 depo. The vehicle must start and end its journey at the depo. The task is to find the shortest and longest routes between cities, ensuring that every city is visited only once.

Implement the algorithm in Python
Find the solutions using Brute force search (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brute-force_search)
Your input must have the following (inputs sets by user):
Number of cities

Your output must have the following:
Shortest path (image of the path, string/array representation of the shortest path, time to find the path)
Longest path (image of the path, string/array representation of the longest path, time to find the path)
